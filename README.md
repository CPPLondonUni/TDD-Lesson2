# TDD Lesson 2 - Blockbusters.

This repository provides you with a very basic framework for developing a simple system
for tracking customers and allowing things to be rented out (such as videos)

The primary goal is to learn mocking, so apply this as you develop the application
through TDD.

## The Task

You are tasked with creating a system that can manage an inventory of rentable items and
take care of allowing them to be rented out to people, with an associated charge for the
permitted duration of rental, plus any penalty applicable to the rental.

### Initial work

Focus on producing (via TDD) a working implementation of a class to track inventory that
is also able to assign a rental into a customer.
